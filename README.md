## Install Instructions
0. Maybe make a **Backup** of your save files - see [Backup save files](#backup-save-files).  
   (Although this Mod _doesn't_ do anything to the original save files directly - and will never do - there is the small possibility that if it breaks something in the game itself, that could corrupt your save file.)

This mod needs **UPM (Unity Plugin Manager)** to work.

1. See its developer **[Install Instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/slimerancher/comments/84ux68/official_thread_debug_menu_mod/)** and follow the first 3 steps of it:  
   
   * **Correct folder?** See [Screenshot for UPM Installation](#screenshot-for-upm-installation).  
   * **How to find your Game folder?** Follow the [instructions here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) in the link - but click **"Browse Local Files..."** instead of "Verify integrity of game files..." as the last step.  
   
2. Afterwards extract the content of the **"HandyUpgrades_CabbageCrow.zip"** from the [latest Release](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/HandyUpgrades/releases/latest) into the new **"Plugin" folder**  
(This zip-archive contains 2 .dll files. You can overwrite the old ones, if you have any.)
   
3. Access the content of the mod by using the **Vacpack Upgrade Terminal**.  
   There are two new Category-Tabs. With the rightmost you can activate Handy Upgrade Packages and by the middle one you can activate the actual Handy Upgrades.  
   (Currently it doesn't save what you have activated, so you have to re-activate all after a reload.)  
   Happy Sliming!

## Backup save files
Go to the "Monomi Park" folder and make a **Copy** of your **"Slime Rancher" folder** to somewhere (e.g. your Desktop).

| System       | Location                                     |
