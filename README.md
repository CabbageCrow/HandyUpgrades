   * Selective Suction  
   For selectively vacuuming stuff up - the others wont get into your vacpack.  
   (To change between modes **configure the controls** in the Options menu.)  
   Modes:  
       * Normal = Normal mode  
       * Medium = **No big stuff** is vacuumed up **(crates, toys, largos)**  
       * Low = **Additionally normal slimes** won't be vacuumed up  
       * Plorts = *Only plorts* are affected  
       * Regulation Kit = Changes all modes so there is **much less bouncing off and muddle**  
   * Suction Booster  
   If enabled you can **vacuum up elated Largos**, recognizable by their big smiles.  
   It works **only on your ranch** and they use up 4 times the space in your vacpack.  
   * Memorizing Feeders  
   Auto feeders **keep the last piece of food**. This way you always know what to refill. And some busy buzzers too.  
   * Ginger Predictor  
   Three different levels **help with finding** the rare veggie. The better the upgrade, the narrower the prediction.  
   * Game Mode Switcher  
   Switches between Adventure and Casual  
   * Screenshot Extension  
     * Added screenshot types **"Scenery"** and **"With UI"**  
     (For the best pics without a blocked view! Or extra blocked! The latter is useful if you want e.g. capture your inventory too.)  
     * You can configure **the saving location** of the Screenshots and GIFs.  
     * **Added buttons** for the new types **to the pause menu**, as well as for recording GIF  
     * **Naming of the files changed**. From 12-hour clock to 24-hour clock, so sorting doesn't get mixed up and added a second hyphens for easier reading.  
   * Silo Slot Self Switcher  
   Silos **switch to another slot** if the item can't be put into the selected one.  
   * Backup of the save file while the mod is active

## Uninstall / Disable the mod
If you want to disable the mod use the disable functionality in the UMF Menu.

### Complete Uninstall
If you need to uninstall your mods completely, follow the instuctions to [Verify Integrity of Game Files](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335). 
This resets your game files to a clean state like a reinstall and doesn't affecting your saves.
It doesn't delete any additional files like the whole UMF folder structure. Yet if you want to use it again, you have run its Setup anew.
