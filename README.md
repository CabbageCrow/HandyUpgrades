## List of features
#### Currently in beta testing: 
   * Selective Suction  
   For selectively vacuuming stuff up - the others wont get into your vacpack.  
   (To change between modes **configure the controls** in the Options menu.)

## Install Instructions
0. Maybe make a **Backup** of your save files - see [Backup save files](#backup-save-files).  
   (Although this Mod currently _doesn't_ do anything to the original save files directly - there is the small possibility that if it breaks something in the game itself, that could corrupt your save file.)



### Using the Installer
1. Try **using the new installer** inside the archive **HandyUpgrades_CabbageCrow_Installer_BETA.zip**  
Get it here, the first link: [Download the latest Release](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/HandyUpgrades/releases/latest)  
You can install it multiple times - it doesn't matter.  
(The installer handles all the prerequisites (UPM) and places the dlls into the right folder.)

### Manual installation
A manual installation is a bit more work and there are more possibilities for mistakes. Try using the Installer first.

This mod needs **UPM (Unity Plugin Manager)** to work. If you have UPM already installed, you can skipt the next step and continue with 2.

1. See its developer **[Install Instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/slimerancher/comments/84ux68/official_thread_debug_menu_mod/)** and follow the first 3 steps of it - However if something is unclear, the following infos might help you:  
   
   * **Correct folder? Is it the "Slime Rancher game folder"?** See [Screenshot for UPM Installation](#screenshot-for-upm-installation).  
   * **How to find your Game folder?** Follow the [instructions here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) in the link - BUT click **"Browse Local Files..."** instead of "Verify integrity of game files..." as the last step.  
   
2. Afterwards extract the content of the **"HandyUpgrades_CabbageCrow.zip"** from the [latest Release](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/HandyUpgrades/releases/latest) into the new **"Plugin" folder**  
(This zip-archive contains 2 .dll files. You can overwrite the old ones, if you have any.  
Make sure that there is only one version of "HandyUpgrades_CabbageCrow" in the folder.)
   
3. Access the content of the mod by using the **Vacpack Upgrade Terminal**.  
   There are two new Category-Tabs. With the rightmost you can activate Handy Upgrade Packages and by the middle one you can activate the actual Handy Upgrades.  
   (Currently it doesn't save what you have activated, so you have to re-activate all after a reload.)  
   Happy Sliming!
   
## Uninstall / Disable the mod
If you want to disable the mod just rename or delete the folder "Plugins" in your game folder ("Slime Rancher", NOT within the "SlimeRancher_Data" folder!)
Note: That will affect all mods which use harmony. If there are more than 2 files within the plugin folder (HandyUpgrades and harmony), you can alternatively just remove the HandyUpgrades file.

## Backup save files
Go to the "Monomi Park" folder and make a **Copy** of your **"Slime Rancher" folder** to somewhere (e.g. your Desktop).

| System       | Location                                     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Windows      | %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Monomi Park\  |
| macOS (OS X) | \~/Library/Application Support/Monomi Park   |
| Linux        | \~/.config/unity3d/Monomi Park               |
